[entity-description]
	boat=Small and fast boat with small inventry space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an indepedent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with SHIFT+ENTER.
	indep-boat=Small and fast boat with small inventroy space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an indepedent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with SHIFT+ENTER.
	cargo_ship=Large cargo ship able to transport vast amount of resources. Enter and leave the ship with SHIFT+ENTER.
	train_carrier=Large carrier ship able to transport entire trains. Enter and leave the ship with SHIFT+ENTER.
	oil_tanker=Large tanker ship able to transport vast amount of fluids. Enter and leave the ship with SHIFT+ENTER.
	ship_pump=Special pump for loading and unloading tank ships. Can be placed on water. 
	oil_rig=Massive swimming extraction platform for deep sea oil. Includes it's own local power generation and electric network, supplying the oil rig itself as well as connected ship loading pumps with energy.
	deep_oil=Large deposite of deep sea oil. Extractable with an oil rig.
	port=Destinations for automated ships.
	buoy=Divides the water way system into blocks, allowing multiple ships to run on the same network.
	chain_buoy=Reads the next signals in the path to allow better control of ships.
	bridge_north_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_east_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_south_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_west_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_base=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Place along an existing straight stretch of waterway. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.

	waterway_reach_increase= Reach increase while holding Water-Ways.

[mod-setting-description]
	waterway_reach_increase=Increase of the Players reach while holding waterways, buoys, ports, etc. Allows to place and deconstruct waterways from far away.  Set to '0' in order to disable the reach increase.
